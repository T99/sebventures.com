				<p>
					A native of Traverse City, I graduated from Saint Francis in
					2003. Throughout high school, I worked for Blue Photo, and
					did senior portraits and weddings in my spare time. After
					high school, I followed my dream of becoming a personal
					trainer by completing the certification for American College
					of Sports Medicine Certified Trainer. While doing personal
					training, I attained a degree in Applied Science from
					Northwestern Michigan College in 2005. With a passion for
					understanding how a business works, I went back to school
					for a Bachelor's degree in Business through Ferris State
					University, which I completed in May of 2009. During the
					final years of college, I ran a full-time personal training
					business that held between 3-5 employees and carried the
					position of Operations Manager for a local business. Upon
					graduating, and with a passion to attain further real-world
					skills, I went to work for Ollar Consulting, where I
					attained a Quickbooks Proadvisor and Microsoft Certified
					Professional certification, as well as invaluable
					experience. Currently, I am dedicating most of my
					professional time to running the Formative Fitness Training
					Studio in downtown Traverse City.
