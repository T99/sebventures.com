I have seen the highs and lows of the various approaches, from the Atkins / low carb diets, to South Beach diets. Instead of turning to strict nutritions or diets, cutting out all of any given food, or avoiding social functions, I have put together a way of eating that involves balance and variety. Many people who are naturally&nbsp;in shape already do a lot of the things I will describe, and yet, most people don't understand or practice these concepts.&nbsp;Even though&nbsp;genetics does play a role, there is a larger component that deals with our current metabolic rate, and we all have significant control over&nbsp;this via our everyday eating and activity. So perhaps this is less about&nbsp;food and more about how to speed up your metablism so you&nbsp;can enjoy the foods you like, and live a balanced life while being&nbsp;healthy. I won't fool you, this isn't easy,&nbsp;but it really works!</p><p>I know that so far this is rather vague, but there will be more to&nbsp;come!&nbsp;</p></div></div></td><td colspan="1" id="sub_nav_column" rowspan="1"><div id="left_column_container"><div id="sub_container1"></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="footer"><div id="footer_text">A work in progress by Sebastian since 08/18/2009</div></div></div><!-- wfxbuild / 1.0 / layout6-126-2 / 2010-02-15 18:58:51 CET--></body></html>
