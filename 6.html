					Over the years, I have seen a lot of "diets" come and go,
					and also watched people take their eating to the extreme
					with ultra-strict eating plans. I have seen the highs and
					lows of the various approaches, from the Atkins / low carb
					diets, to South Beach diets. Instead of turning to strict
					nutritions or diets, cutting out all of any given food, or
					avoiding social functions, I have put together a way of
					eating that involves balance and variety. Many people who
					are naturally in shape already do a lot of the things I will
					describe, and yet, most people don't understand or practice
					these concepts. Even though genetics does play a role, there
					is a larger component that deals with our current metabolic
					rate, and we all have significant control over this via our
					everyday eating and activity. So perhaps this is less about
					food and more about how to speed up your metablism so you
					can enjoy the foods you like, and live a balanced life while
					being healthy. I won't fool you, this isn't easy, but it
					really works!

				<p>
					I know that so far this is rather vague, but there will be
					more to come!
